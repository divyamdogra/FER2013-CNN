<h3> 1. The main goal was to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) using Transfer Learning (vgg16 model) on top of conv2d layer which recognize facial expressions - 7 different emotions. <br>
  2. Code available in this repository allows you to train a CNN model which achieves 80%+ accuracy. </h3>
