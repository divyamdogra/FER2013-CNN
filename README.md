# FER2013-CNN

<h3> 1. The main goal was to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) using Transfer Learning (vgg16 model) on top of conv2d layer which recognize facial expressions - 7 different emotions. <br><br>
  2. Code available in this repository allows you to train a CNN model which achieves 80%+ accuracy. <br><br>
   3. You can download dataset from Kaggle and upload on Google Colab or use code in file to download the dataset while your own kaggle json.</h3>
